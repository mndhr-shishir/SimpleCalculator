# SimpleCalculator
Simple command line calculator I created by following **Ruslan Spivak's** amazing [Let's Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) tutorial series.

The codebase is almost the same except the calculator now can handle **unary operations** and parse **decimal numbers**. 

# To Run It
Simply git clone this repostiory and cd into it and run *python main.py*.

There are clearly many issues and many more features to add to it, but until then **Have fun playing with it!**
